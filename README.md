## Future Goals
1. Use Stemming and Lemmatization to parse parts of speech to form more centralized and non redundant questions
2. Implement Active Recall Learning; have quiz questions notify user at periodic intervals for higher retention rate
3. Use Stanford NPL Library to ensure semantically and syntacically correct and context based questions
4. Add visualizations that appeal to visual and kinesthetic learners
